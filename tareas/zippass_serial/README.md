# ZIPPASS_SERIAL

## Problem Description

As part of the Parallel and Concurrent Computing class we have been provided with several zip files with encrypted text files inside which we need to read. 

For this problem, a solution using a single-threaded "brute force" algorithm must be accomplished. Apart from this, the algorithm should be efficient enough to run all medium test cases in an hour or less.
